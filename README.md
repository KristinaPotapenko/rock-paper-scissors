# ✂️📄 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple and fun implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game as a web application.

## 🎮 About the Game

This project recreates the timeless game where the player competes against the computer. The rules are simple:

- **Rock** crushes Scissors  
- **Scissors** cuts Paper
